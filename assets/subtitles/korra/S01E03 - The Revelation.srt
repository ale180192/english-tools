1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,002
Earth.

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,878
Fire.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,672
Air.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,965
Water.

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,389
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,438
A chance encounter turns Korra

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,357
from Pro-bending spectator
to Pro-bending star!

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,192
With her new teammates,
Mako and Bolin,

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,945
the Fire Ferrets earn a place
in the Championship Tournament!

11
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,907
But meanwhile, an anti-bending
revolution brews in Republic City.

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,992
Who are the Equalists?

13
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,995
And what nefarious plan does
the mysterious man behind the mask

14
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,997
have in store for our hero?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,074


16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,012
What's the big idea with making me
train this early in the morning?

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,972
The morning is evil.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,184
We're the rookies,
so we get the worst time slot in the gym.

19
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,019
And you're the rookiest of us all.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,122
We gotta get you up to speed

21
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,022
if we want to survive in the tournament.

22
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,565
Deal with it.

23
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,858
You deal with it.

24
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,572
There are my little, hard workin'
street urchins!

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,368
It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar.

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,953
And you are?

27
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,455
Butakha.

28
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,041
I run this whole Pro-bending shebang.

29
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,627
Here's your winnings
from the last match.

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,089
Not so fast!

31
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,758
First, you owe me
for the Avatar's new gear...

32
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,052
Gym and equipment rentals
for last month...

33
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,721
Rent on your apartment...

34
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,516
And a personal loan for groceries.

35
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,436
What? I'm a growing boy!

36
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,523
And one more small item of business,

37
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,734
the Fire Ferrets need to ante up
30,000 yuans

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,069
for the championship pot.

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,071
30,000 yuans!

40
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,406
Sorry, kids.

41
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,302
You got till the end of the week
to come up with the dough,

42
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,077
or else you're out of the tournament.

43
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,915
You wouldn't happen to have
a secret Avatar bank account

44
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,625
overflowing with gold, would you?

45
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,087
I got nothing.
I've never really needed money.

46
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,047
I've always had people
taking care of me.

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,383
Then I wouldn't say you have nothing.

48
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,009
Sorry. I didn't mean...

49
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,595
No, it's all right. It's just...

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,723
Ever since we lost our parents,
we've been on our own.

51
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,101
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

52
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,312
So anyway, how are we gonna
come up with the money?

53
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,106
I got it! I got it!

54
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,150
I've been training Pabu
to do circus tricks.

55
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,861
Now, people would pay good money
to see that!

56
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,030
Come on, Bolin, we need serious ideas.

57
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,282
I was serious.

58
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,285
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.

59
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,870
I always do.

60
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,670
Come one, come all!

61
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:57,134
See Pabu the Fantastic Fire Ferret
as he crosses the Ladder of Peril,

62
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,845
upside down!

63
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,353
Big finish, buddy! Stick the landing!

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,649
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

65
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,152
You are too kind. Seriously, too kind.

66
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,154
You can come back here
and put money right in this...

67
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,822
Okay, that's fine, that's fine.

68
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,327
One yuan down, 29,999 to go.

69
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,707
Hey, Bolin. Is that you?

70
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,168
Hey there, Shady Shin!

71
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,174
Heard you're a big time
Pro-bending player now. Not bad!

72
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,259
Thanks.

73
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,346
So listen, I got an offer for ya.

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,308
Lightning Bolt Zolt is looking
to hire some extra muscle.

75
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,645
I don't know, Shin.

76
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,147
Mako told me to stay away
from the Triple Threats.

77
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,858
Your brother ain't the boss of you.

78
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,946
It's just a little security work,
nothin' crooked.

79
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,494
You game?

80
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,052
Bo, I'm back.

81
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,096
Picked up your favorite dumplings.

82
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,475
Hey, I found some work
down at the power plant.

83
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,435
Made some decent money.

84
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,231
Bolin? You here, bro?

85
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,284
I bet the little love bird
is making a house call.

86
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,959
Good! Light on your feet!

87
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,548
He's cute.

88
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,260
Korra, is that the handsome
Firebender boy that drives you crazy?

89
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,928
Does he drive you crazy in a bad way,

90
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,222
or does he drive you crazy
like you like him?

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,185
Hey, Mako.

92
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,022
- You seen Bolin?
- Nice to see you, too.

93
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,399
And, no,
I haven't seen him since practice.

94
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,943
- Think something's wrong?
- I don't know.

95
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,280
Bolin has a knack
for getting into stupid situations.

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,281
See you later.

97
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,951
Wait, I could help you look for him.

98
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,244
Nah, I got it.

99
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,998
Hey, cool guy, let me help you.
We can take Naga.

100
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,958
- Who's Naga?
- My best friend.

101
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,585
And a great tracker.

102
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,965
Your best friend is a polar bear-dog.

103
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,259
Somehow that makes perfect sense.

104
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,553
I'll take that as a compliment, city boy.

105
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,856
Well, this is his usual hangout.

106
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,404
You guys seen my brother
around here today?

107
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,241
Perhaps. My memory's a little foggy.

108
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,577
Maybe you can help clear it up.

109
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,872
You're good, Skoochy. A real pro.

110
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,624
Yeah, I seen him.

111
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,250
- When?
- About noon.

112
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,335
What was he doing?

113
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,338
He was performing
some kind of monkey-rat circus.

114
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,464
And then...

115
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,343
And then what? Why'd he leave?

116
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,347
Shady Shin showed up
and flashed some serious cash.

117
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,224
Bo took off with him in his hot rod.

118
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,894
The Triple Threats, the Red Monsoons,
the Agni Kais,

119
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,480
all the Triads are muscling up
for something real big.

120
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,357
Now that's all you're getting out of me!

121
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,276
What's he talking about?

122
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,570
Sounds like there's a turf war brewing,

123
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,365
and Bolin's about to get caught
right in the middle of it.

124
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,374
So where are we headed?

125
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,209
The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters.

126
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,378
Hopefully Bolin is there
and nothing's gone down yet.

127
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,712
Triple Threat Triad?

128
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,298
I beat up some of those yahoos
when I got into town.

129
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,551
Why would Bolin get tangled up with...

130
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,511
Whoa, Naga!

131
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,518
That's Pabu!

132
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,230
No, Naga. Pabu's a friend, not a snack.

133
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,445
We gotta hurry.

134
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,658
Something's not right.

135
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,203
There are usually thugs posted
out front. We better be cautious.

136
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,176
Bolin? You in here?

137
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,313
Bolin!

138
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,447
Naga! Come!

139
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,804
I can't bend...

140
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,055
I can't bend!

141
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,182
Calm down. It'll wear off.

142
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,892
Those guys were Chi-blockers.

143
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,936
- They're Amon's henchmen.
- Amon?

144
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,689
That anti-bending guy with the mask?

145
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,442
Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists.

146
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,277
What do they want
with the Triple Threats?

147
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,988
Whatever it is, can't be good.

148
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,784
I can't believe
Bolin got himself into this mess!

149
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,662
Mako, we are going to save
your brother.

150
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,581
I promise you that.

151
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,806
We've been out all night.
No sign of him.

152
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,060
We've gotta keep looking. But where?

153
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,604
I have an idea!

154
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,574
The first day I got into town,

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,243
I ran into an Equalist protestor
over there.

156
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,847
And you think they'll know
where Bolin is?

157
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,622
It's our only lead right now.

158
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:19,344
So, why is Bolin running around with
the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?

159
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,681
Well, we used to do some work
for them back in the day.

160
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,475
What? Are you some kind of criminal?

161
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,395
No, you don't know
what you're talking about!

162
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,522
I just ran numbers for them and stuff.

163
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,023
We were orphans, out on the street.

164
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,943
I did what I had to do to survive
and protect my little brother.

165
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,612
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,572
It must have been really hard.

167
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,617
Can I ask...

168
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,369
What happened to your parents?

169
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,332
They were mugged by a Firebender.

170
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,752
He cut them down right in front of me.
I was eight.

171
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,422
Mako...

172
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,299
Bolin's the only family I have left.

173
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,135
If anything happened to him...

174
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,685
Equality now! Equality now!

175
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,062
We want equality now!

176
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,067
Non-benders of Republic City...

177
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,235
That's the guy.

178
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,695
Amon calls you to action!

179
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,407
Take back your city! It's time for...

180
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,702
It's you again!

181
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,580
You cannot silence me, Avatar!

182
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,167
Shut your yapper and listen up.

183
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,937
My friend got kidnapped
by some Chi-blockers.

184
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,044
Where'd they take him?

185
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,714
I have no idea what you're talking about!

186
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,257
I think you do.

187
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,813
"Witness the Revelation. Tonight. 9:00."

188
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,523
What's this Revelation?

189
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,610
Nothing that concerns
the likes of you two!

190
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,739
You better believe it concerns us.
Spill it.

191
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,991
No one knows what the Revelation is,

192
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,577
and I have no idea
what happened to your friend.

193
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,953
But if he's a bender,

194
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,247
then my bet is
he's getting what's coming to him.

195
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,791
Where's it happening?

196
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,336
Hey! What's going on over there?

197
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,214
The Avatar's oppressing us! Help!

198
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,132
Let's scram.

199
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,225
Why didn't the Equalists
put a location on these?

200
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,287
Probably because they don't want
just anyone waltzing into

201
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,772
their big Revelation, whatever that is.

202
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,316
I bet the information is hidden
on here somehow.

203
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,611
Look at the backs.
There's four different images.

204
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,781
So, it's a puzzle?

205
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,367
Yeah... Of a map!

206
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,377
Bingo! That must be
where it's going down.

207
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,854
This is the place.

208
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,905
- What are you doing?
- We'll attract less attention this way.

209
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,035
This is a private event.
No one gets in without an invitation.

210
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,913
Invitation...

211
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,916
You mean this?

212
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,630
The Revelation is upon us,
my brother and sister.

213
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,598
I knew a lot of people hated benders,

214
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,892
but I've never seen so many
in one place.

215
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,436
Keep your eyes out for Bolin.

216
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,277
Please welcome your hero,

217
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,404
your savior,

218
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,990
Amon!

219
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,467
My quest for equality
began many years ago.

220
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:32,013
When I was a boy,
my family and I lived on a small farm.

221
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,099
We weren't rich.
And none of us were benders.

222
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,061
This made us very easy targets

223
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,522
for the Firebender
who extorted my father.

224
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,485
One day, my father confronted this man,

225
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,445
but when he did,

226
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,032
that Firebender took my family
from me...

227
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,910
Then, he took my face.

228
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,581
I've been forced to hide behind a mask
ever since.

229
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,584
As you know,

230
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,171
the Avatar has recently arrived
in Republic City.

231
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,175
And if she were here,

232
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,429
she would tell you that bending
brings balance to the world.

233
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,473
But she is wrong.

234
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,936
The only thing bending has brought
to the world is suffering.

235
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,148
It has been the cause of every war
in every era.

236
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,777
But that is about to change.

237
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,657
I know you have been wondering,
what is the Revelation?

238
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,201
You are about to get your answer.

239
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,288
Since the beginning of time,

240
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,209
the Spirits have acted as guardians
of our world.

241
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,962
And they have spoken to me.

242
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,882
They say the Avatar has failed humanity.

243
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,886
That is why the Spirits have chosen me

244
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,348
to usher in a new era of balance.

245
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,309
They have granted me a power

246
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,063
that will make equality a reality,

247
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,026
the power to take
a person's bending away...

248
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,153
Permanently.

249
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,490
That's impossible. There's no way...

250
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,034
This guy's insane.

251
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,703
Now, for a demonstration.

252
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,123
Please welcome Lightning Bolt Zolt,

253
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,917
leader of the Triple Threat Triad

254
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,005
and one of the most notorious criminals
in Republic City.

255
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,008
"Boo" yourself!

256
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,724
- There's Bolin!
- Wait.

257
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,727
We can't fight them all.
We need to be smart about this.

258
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,813
Then come up with a game plan,
team captain.

259
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:51,152
Zolt has amassed a fortune
by extorting and abusing non-benders,

260
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,156
but his reign of terror
is about to come to an end!

261
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,034
Now, in the interest of fairness,

262
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,371
I will give Zolt the chance
to fight to keep his bending.

263
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,124
You're gonna regret doing that, pal.

264
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,203
What did you do to me?

265
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,082
Your firebending is gone. Forever.

266
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,089
The era of bending is over.

267
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,385
A new era of equality has begun!

268
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,308
Any ideas yet?

269
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,727
I think so. See those machines?

270
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,312
They're powered by water and steam.

271
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,399
If you create some cover,
I can grab Bolin without anyone seeing.

272
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,943
- Then, we duck out of here.
- Works for me.

273
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,945
Mako, good luck.

274
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,113
You, too.

275
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,127
It's not enough.

276
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,796
Hey, you!

277
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,684
Is there a problem, my brother?

278
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,352
What are you doing back here?

279
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,689
Looking for the bathroom?

280
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,492
Come on...

281
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,961
Thanks. This should be enough.

282
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,892
Hello, Amon, sir.

283
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,187
I think
there's been a big misunderstanding...

284
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
Bolin, you all right?

285
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,378
Yes! Mako! I love you!

286
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,558
You benders need to understand,

287
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,728
there's no place in the world
for you anymore.

288
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,278
I wouldn't count us out just yet.

289
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,488
Naga!

290
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,293
I want to be on your back.

291
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,295
The Avatar. That's her!

292
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,090
Let her go.

293
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,552
She's the perfect messenger
to tell the city of my power.

294
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,312
Thank goodness!

295
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,898
I was just about to send out
a search party. Are you all right?

296
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,444
Korra, what happened?

297
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,405
- Did you find your friend?
- Yes, but...

298
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,326
I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon.

299
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,369
What?

300
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,788
He can take people's bending away.

301
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,040
- For good.
- That's...

302
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,333
That's impossible.

303
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,960
Only the Avatar has ever possessed
that ability.

304
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,088
But I saw him do it.

305
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,340
I believe you.

306
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,343
I don't know how Amon has achieved
this power,

307
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,347
but this means the revolution
is more dangerous than ever.

308
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,266
No bender is safe.

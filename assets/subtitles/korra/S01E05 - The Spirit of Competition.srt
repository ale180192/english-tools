1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,459
Earth.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,878
Fire.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,505
Air.

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,965
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,305
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,479
Love is in the air!

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,065
Since Avatar Korra
has arrived in Republic City,

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,235
she's only had eyes
for one fellow, Mako.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,947
The feeling seemed mutual
until a fateful accident intervened.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,075
Now, Mako's affections have fallen
right into the arms

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,910
of the beautiful Asami.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,622
Will love prove to be Korra's
most formidable foe yet?

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,026
It's been great having you at so many
back-to-back practices, Korra.

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,402
Feels good to be back,

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,197
although Tarrlok isn't too happy
about my leave of absence.

17
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,658
Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets
before you joined his task force.

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,327
Okay, come on, team huddle time!

19
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,755
It's our first match
of the tournament tonight.

20
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,633
I know the three of us haven't been
a team for very long, but even so,

21
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,010
the Fire Ferrets have never been
this good.

22
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,929
- Are we ready?
- We're ready!

23
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,057
Not quite. You'll need these!

24
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,601
- Hey, Asami.
- Good morning, sweetie.

25
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,064
- These new uniforms look great!
- You look great, champ!

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,776
Well, teammates,

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,903
I'll see you before the match tonight,

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,446
Asami and I have a lunch date.

29
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,017
Okay, we'll check you guys later,

30
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,634
you know,
we'll see you when we see you.

31
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,371
So, Korra...

32
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,499
There they go, here we are,

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,417
all alone in the gym.

34
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,461
Just you and me.

35
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,131
Two alone people,

36
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,007
together.

37
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,093
Alone.

38
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,097
I gotta head back to the Air Temple
to train with Tenzin. See you!

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,103
Work with me here, Pabu!

40
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,605
You want to look spick and span
in your new uniform, don't you?

41
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,405
So what do you think of Korra, in a

42
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,323
girlfriend sort of way?

43
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,741
She's great!

44
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,286
But I think it makes more sense
for me to go for Asami.

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,663
I was talking about a girlfriend for me!

46
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,373
Leave some ladies for the rest of us!

47
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,292
I know, that's what I thought you meant.

48
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,044
- Well?
- I don't know, Bo.

49
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,190
It doesn't seem like a good idea
for you to date Korra.

50
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,757
You just said she was great
two seconds ago.

51
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,553
Yeah, Korra is a great athlete
and Avatar and stuff, but...

52
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,657
I don't know if she is really
"girlfriend material."

53
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,141
- She's more like a pal.
- Bro, you're nuts!

54
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,894
Korra and I are perfect for each other!

55
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,813
She's strong, I'm strong.
She's fun, I'm fun.

56
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,149
She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!

57
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,527
Okay, I don't care what you think,
I'm gonna ask Korra out.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,405
Look, it just isn't smart
to date a teammate,

59
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,073
especially during the tournament.

60
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,035
Keep your head out of the clouds
and your priorities straight.

61
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,871
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I know!

62
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,831
You know what I'm talking about, Pabu.

63
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,791
Talking about real love...

64
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,721
So how's it going with the tall,
dreamy Firebender boy?

65
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,474
You've been spending
a lot of time together lately.

66
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,353
Yeah, tell us all
about the magical romance.

67
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,064
What? Listen to you two,

68
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,192
I'm not interested in Mako
or any romantic stuff.

69
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,196
Besides, he's all into that prissy,
beautiful, elegant, rich girl.

70
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,408
But let's just pretend for a second
I am interested in him,

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,534
what would I do?

72
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,287
I just read a historical saga,

73
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,499
where the heroine fell in love
with the enemy general's son,

74
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,417
who's supposed to marry the princess.

75
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,670
- You should do what she did.
- Tell me!

76
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,382
She rode a dragon into battle
and burned down the entire country,

77
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,219
then she jumped into a volcano.
It was so romantic.

78
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,429
No, no, no!

79
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,834
The best way to win a boy's heart

80
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,141
is to brew a love potion
of rainbows and sunsets

81
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,645
that makes true lovers sprout wings
and fly into a magical castle in the sky,

82
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,624
where they get married
and eat clouds with spoons,

83
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,774
and use stars as ice cubes
in their moonlight punch.

84
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,359
For ever and ever and ever!

85
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,654
The volcano is starting
to make more sense to me now.

86
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,992
Hey, Pema.

87
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,952
How long were you standing there?

88
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,538
Long enough.

89
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,499
But trust me,
I know what you're going through.

90
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,545
Years ago, I was in the exact
same situation with Tenzin.

91
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,256
Daddy was in love with someone else
before you?

92
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,258
- That's right.
- So what did you do?

93
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,844
Well, for the longest time, I did nothing.

94
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,346
I was so shy and scared of rejection...

95
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,891
But watching my soul mate
spend his life with the wrong woman

96
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,435
became too painful.

97
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,314
So I hung my chin out there
and I confessed my love to Tenzin.

98
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,190
And the rest is history.

99
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,576
Folks, after a year of waiting,

100
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,580
the Pro-bending championship
tournament is finally here.

101
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,457
Tonight is the first set of matches

102
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,376
in our single elimination
16 team bracket.

103
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,669
And I gotta tell you,

104
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,755
these are the most
tenacious and talented

105
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,299
bending trios this arena has ever seen.

106
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,178
Introducing our first team,

107
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,307
the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!

108
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,187
And their opponents,

109
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,940
the Red Sands Rabbiroos.

110
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,573
What an explosive opening volley!

111
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,910
Both teams quickly recover
and unleash a barrage of bending.

112
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,329
I am astonished
with the level of improvement

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,206
displayed here by the Fire Ferrets.

114
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,917
No wonder the Avatar
has been absent from the papers lately.

115
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,712
She's obviously had her nose
to the grindstone in the gym.

116
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,517
The Ferrets advance
into Rabbiroo territory,

117
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,341
and they're holding nothing back.

118
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,884
Nice sprawl there by Mako,

119
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,969
Bolin strikes, Ula dodges

120
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,347
and all three Rabbiroos are down!

121
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,058
The Fire Ferrets easily take round one.

122
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,394
Round two!

123
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,147
The Rabbiroos are looking for payback,
and they go straight after Bolin.

124
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,774
Korra comes to his defense,

125
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,485
and she water-whacks
Umi back into zone two!

126
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,364
The Ferrets are on fire tonight,
and they win round two.

127
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,325
Round three!

128
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,787
With the Rabbiroos down two rounds,
they'll need a knockout to win,

129
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,671
and with the way
the Fire Ferrets are playing,

130
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,707
I don't see that happening.

131
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,381
These Ferrets are working together
like a well-oiled bending machine.

132
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,385
Bolin bashes Adi back into zone two,

133
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,388
and the Ferrets
get the green light to advance.

134
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,391
The Rabbiroos are just fighting
to stay on their feet at this point.

135
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,686
Down goes Adi, and Ula and Umi!

136
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,440
All three rounds go to
the Future Industries Fire Ferrets,

137
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,401
who win their opening match
of the tournament!

138
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,404
- Yes!
- That's what I'm talking about!

139
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,386
- Thank you, thank you very much!
- Wow, we were really connecting

140
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,411
- out there in that ring!
- Yeah!

141
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,974
You know, I feel like the two of us
have been connecting really well

142
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,416
- out of the ring, too.
- Sure.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,210
So, I was thinking we should
spend some time together.

144
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,296
We've been spending
lots of time together.

145
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,797
I mean, outside of the gym.

146
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,008
And not while searching
for kidnapped family members

147
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,426
or fighting Chi-blockers.

148
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,428
I don't know.

149
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,221
- Asami and I...
- Look, I really like you,

150
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,348
and I think we were meant
for each other.

151
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,729
Korra, I'm really sorry, but...

152
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,732
I just don't feel the same way about you.

153
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,109
Forget I ever said anything.

154
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,447
Congratulations, guys!

155
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,200
You were so amazing out there.

156
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,878
So, Korra, I was thinking...

157
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,589
You and me, we could go get
some dinner together...

158
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,926
Sort of a date situation.

159
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,095
That's really sweet, but I don't think so.

160
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,641
- I don't feel very date-worthy.
- Are you kidding me?

161
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,852
You're the smartest, funniest,
toughest, buffest, talentedest,

162
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,479
incrediblest girl in the world!

163
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,482
You really feel that way about me?

164
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,485
I felt that way
since the moment I saw you.

165
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,488
Trust me, I know we're gonna have
so much fun together.

166
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,407
You know what? I could use some fun.

167
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,368
- Okay, sure.
- Yes!

168
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,746
Who's the luckiest guy in the world?
Right here, Bolin!

169
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,393
- So how'd you like it?
- It's delicious!

170
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,103
And totally authentic.

171
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,814
I didn't realize how much I missed
Water Tribe grub.

172
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,899
That's great,
'cause this is my favorite joint.

173
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,986
See? You love Water Tribe food,
I love Water Tribe food,

174
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,697
just another reason
we are so great together.

175
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,323
They are good noodles!

176
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,536
Hey, who's that creepy guy over there
that keeps glaring at us?

177
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,539
That's Tahno and the Wolf-bats.

178
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,208
Reigning champs, three years running.

179
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,751
Don't make eye contact.

180
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,553
Here he comes.

181
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,681
Now don't mess with this guy,
he's a nasty dude.

182
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,479
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Fire Ferrets.

183
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,566
Pro-bending's saddest excuse
for a team.

184
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,693
Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs
like you

185
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,570
luck your way into the tournament?

186
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,905
Especially you, Avatar.

187
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,910
You know, if you'd like to learn
how a real pro bends,

188
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,580
I could give you some private lessons.

189
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,833
You wanna go toe-to-toe with me,
pretty boy?

190
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,128
Go for it. I'll give you the first shot.

191
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,921
Korra, don't.

192
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,216
He's just trying to bait you. If you
hit him, we're out of the tournament.

193
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,697
I've never seen someone
razz Tahno like that.

194
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,450
You are one of a kind, Korra.

195
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,246
- What kind of game are you playing?
- Pro-bending?

196
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,416
- We've got a quarterfinal match.
- No, I mean with Bolin.

197
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,479
You've got him all in a tizzy and I know
you're only using him to get back at me.

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,796
I am not, we're just having fun together.

199
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,799
- What do you care, anyway?
- I'm looking out for my little brother.

200
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,677
- I don't wanna see his heart get broken.
- Wait a second.

201
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,638
You're not worried about him.
You're jealous!

202
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,517
- You do have feelings for me.
- What? "Jealous"?

203
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,352
Don't be ridiculous.

204
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,563
Admit it, you like me.

205
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,690
No. I'm with Asami!

206
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,336
Yeah, but when you're with her,
you're thinking about me, aren't you?

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,695
- Get over yourself!
- I'm just being honest!

208
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,697
- You're crazy!
- You're a liar!

209
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,868
Hey, Mako...

210
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,162
Eight teams have been eliminated

211
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,497
and eight advance
into the quarterfinals,

212
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,541
which get under way tonight.

213
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,003
The rookies are about to take on the
former and longest reigning champs,

214
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,629
the Boar-Q-pines.

215
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,465
Youth clashes against experience

216
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,341
in a battle for the ages,

217
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,427
or rather, of the ages.

218
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,729
Korra dodges and
slams right into her teammate!

219
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,900
Down goes Mako, and Bolin and Korra!

220
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,862
Round one goes to the Boar-Q-pines!

221
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,031
You were supposed to defend
while I attacked!

222
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,366
I had an opening, so I took it!

223
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,743
What is up with you two?

224
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,120
All right, whatever,
just pull it together, guys.

225
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,750
The Ferrets looking to mount
some offense here in round two.

226
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,676
Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks.

227
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,763
He's a one man bending battalion.

228
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,558
The Ferrets having a tough time
finding their rhythm tonight,

229
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,770
but thanks to Bolin,
they narrowly notch round two.

230
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,109
Not sure what's eating them,

231
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,613
but this is not the same team
who took out the Rabbiroos.

232
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,699
Round three is a tie!

233
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,036
We go to a tie-breaker
to decide the match.

234
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,792
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!

235
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,586
- Which element do you choose?
- I got this.

236
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,382
I know you usually handle these,
but frankly, your head's not in the game.

237
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,175
I'm gonna take this one.

238
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,803
We choose earth.

239
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,181
Looks like the Earthbenders will collide

240
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,308
in the tie-breaker face-off.

241
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,153
Bolin goes in for the grapple.

242
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,822
Chang reverses.

243
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,826
Bolin strikes from midair, knocking
Chang to the edge of the circle.

244
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,705
Another strike from Bolin,
and Chang's in the drink!

245
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,624
The Future Industries Fire Ferrets

246
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,460
win their quarterfinal match!

247
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,754
That was a close one, folks.

248
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,923
Youth trumps experience tonight.

249
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,847
We need to talk.

250
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,766
Look, sometimes you can be
so infuriating. I...

251
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,976
Save your breath.

252
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,103
You've already made it clear
how you feel about me.

253
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,980
No, I haven't.

254
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,857
What I'm trying to say is,

255
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,775
as much as you drive me crazy,

256
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,861
I also think you're pretty amazing.

257
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,865
- So, you do like me?
- Yes! But...

258
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,911
I like Asami, too.
I don't know, things are complicated.

259
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,121
I've been feeling really confused...

260
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,352
Bolin, this isn't what you think.

261
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,399
- Great! Look what you did!
- You're blaming me?

262
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,152
- You kissed me!
- You kissed me back!

263
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,784
Well played, Korra.

264
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,959
Morning, Narook. My brother here?

265
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,086
Thanks.

266
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,923
Come on, wake up.

267
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,800
Taking you home, bro.

268
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,095
Don't call me that.

269
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,930
You're not my brother!

270
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,265
You're a brother betrayer!

271
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,478
The only one I can trust anymore

272
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,313
is Pabu.

273
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,941
Pabu loves me.

274
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,070
You're a mess, and we've got
the biggest match of our lives tonight.

275
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,863
- Let's go.
- No!

276
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,032
I'm not going anywhere with you!

277
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,826
You traitor!

278
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,510
Guess I'll have to do this the hard way.

279
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,664
Why?

280
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,501
I told you dating
a teammate was a bad idea.

281
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,378
You're a bad idea!

282
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:51,801
Put me down!

283
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,907
You can't find two teams
more evenly matched

284
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,743
in age, size and strength

285
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,037
than the Fire Ferrets
and the Buzzard Wasps.

286
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,997
Believe me, I've looked!

287
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,333
This should be a pulse-pounding
semifinal, folks!

288
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,632
The Buzzard Wasps open with
a flawlessly executed combo!

289
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,136
All three Ferrets take an early visit
to zone two!

290
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,056
And Mako's knocked
all the way back into zone three!

291
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,225
The Fire Ferrets have been struggling
to stay alive since the opening bell.

292
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,312
All three players
are totally out of sync tonight.

293
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,981
That has got to sting!

294
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,988
And Bolin loses his noodles.

295
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,782
Literally! Which reminds me,

296
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,034
this match is brought to you
by our sponsor,

297
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,786
Flamey-O Instant Noodles.

298
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,163
Noodliest noodles
in the United Republic!

299
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,047
The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper
into Ferret territory.

300
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,637
And Mako plunges into the pool!

301
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,722
Can the Fire Ferrets hold on?

302
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,142
The Wasps have the Ferrets
backed up to the edge now.

303
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,063
And the Ferrets
are bailed out by the bell!

304
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,982
They had better pull themselves
together, folks, for round two,

305
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,819
otherwise they can kiss
the finals good-bye!

306
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,121
Hey! Watch it!

307
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,082
The Wasps take advantage
of Mako's unforced error,

308
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,084
and Bolin's in the pool!

309
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,256
And a blatant hold by the Avatar!

310
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,426
Unnecessary roughness!
Move back one zone!

311
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,096
I'll unnecessarily rough you up!

312
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,891
And the Avatar is slapped
with the yellow fan!

313
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,727
The Ferrets are their own worst enemy
right now.

314
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,729
It's just sad to watch.

315
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,357
With the Buzzard Wasps leading
two rounds to zilch,

316
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,985
the Ferrets' only hope of winning
is with a knockout.

317
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,421
Well, I guess there's always next year.

318
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,322
Come on, we still have a chance,
even if it is a slim one.

319
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,118
The way we're playing, we don't even
deserve to be in the finals.

320
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,871
Look, if we don't pull together
and work as a team,

321
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,040
- we'll never forgive ourselves.
- Let's just get this over with.

322
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,584
The sooner, the better.

323
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,390
Bolin's knocked into zone two,
followed quickly by his brother.

324
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,771
And Bolin takes a zinger
to the shoulder.

325
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,398
Looks like it's a clean hit.

326
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,818
Bolin!

327
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,529
Mako's in the drink
and out of the match.

328
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,157
And Bolin keeps playing
with one good arm!

329
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,618
I got to hand it to him, this kid's got grit.

330
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,369
But how long can he keep it up?

331
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,288
Apparently, not very long.

332
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,582
The Ferrets' dream
of making it to the finals

333
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,667
now rests in the Avatar's hands.

334
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,170
But with three on one,
I don't like her odds.

335
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,177
Are you okay? How's your shoulder?

336
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,512
It's messed up pretty bad.

337
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,381
But I think I'll be all right.

338
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,063
Are we gonna be all right?

339
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,523
Of course we are. We're brothers.

340
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,359
We'll get through this mess.

341
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,862
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

342
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,490
- Girls.
- Seriously.

343
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,368
What an unbelievable effort here
by Korra.

344
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,454
She's dodging every element
the Wasps throw at her.

345
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,625
The Avatar finally gains some ground,

346
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,962
but with only 10 seconds remaining,
it might be too little, too late.

347
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,551
It's the big kabosh! What a knockout!

348
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,931
- Yes!
- We did it!

349
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,224
Yes!

350
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,850
It didn't seem possible, folks,

351
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,228
but the Fire Ferrets
are headed to the finals!

352
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,315
- Shoulder, shoulder!
- Sorry!

353
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,445
That was pretty much
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

354
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,406
Thanks for not giving up on us.

355
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,741
We never would have
made it this far without you.

356
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,244
I owe you. Big time.

357
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,037
You're welcome.

358
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,372
So...

359
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,916
I know things are confusing right now.

360
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,919
- But I hope we can still be friends.
- Definitely.

361
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,176
You boys smell something in here?

362
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,513
Wait, I know what that is.

363
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,348
Yeah, that's the scent of losers.

364
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,726
I hope we see you in the finals.

365
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,644
Then we'll see who the losers really are.

366
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,895
Yeah.

367
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,814
I'm peeing in my pants over here.

368
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,318
And now, the defending champs,

369
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,654
the White Falls Wolf-bats!

370
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,448
Great job!

371
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,284
What a comeback, Korra!

372
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,454
- I've never seen a hat trick like that.
- Thanks.

373
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,748
But if it hadn't been
for you and your father,

374
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,666
we wouldn't have had
the chance to play.

375
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,084
So, thank you.

376
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,337
If everyone's done
with the little thank you party,

377
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,297
I need some
medical attention over here!

378
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,381
Let me help!

379
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,510
Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?

380
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,721
Relax, I'm a healer.

381
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,223
I learned from Katara, the best there is.

382
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,933
No, no, no, no...

383
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,895
That's the stuff.

384
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,398
Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

385
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,234
I didn't mean to let things
get so out of hand.

386
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,737
I'll be all right.

387
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,324
- But we had fun together, didn't we?
- I had a great time, honestly!

388
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,202
You are one of a kind, Bolin.

389
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,330
Please, go on. I enjoy praise.

390
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,332
Your winners!

391
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,292
The Wolf-bats!

392
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,586
What? How is it over already?

393
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,464
With a brutal round one knockout,

394
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,550
the defending champs
secure their spot in the finals.

395
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,346
I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor,
because they're gonna need one!

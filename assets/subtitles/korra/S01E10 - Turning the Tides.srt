1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,168
Earth.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,962
Fire.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,755
Air.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,965
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,139
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,731
Amon's revolution grows stronger
by the day!

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,524
First, he attacked the bending arena!

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,068
Then it was discovered that
Hiroshi Sato was the mastermind

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,779
behind the Equalist gloves
and mecha-tanks!

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,490
And most recently,
Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok,

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,660
took his bending, and nearly captured
the Avatar, as well!

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,911
Everyone is on edge,

14
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,039
wondering where will Amon strike next?

15
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,785
Daddy, you're home.

16
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,454
We waited up for you. ls Korra okay?

17
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,206
Yes, she's fine, sweetie.

18
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,794
I was scared.
I thought she wasn't coming back.

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,462
I'm sorry you were scared.

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,049
But everything is going to be fine now.
I promise.

21
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,643
The food tastes amazing, Pema.

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,686
I'm finally starting to feel
like myself again.

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,064
We're so thankful you're home safe.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,399
Let me help.

25
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,318
Korra, I realize you've been
through a lot,

26
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,487
but I need to know everything
that happened.

27
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:58,283
Well, first off,
Tarrlok isn't who he says he is.

28
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,077
He's Yakone's son.

29
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,454
It all makes sense now.

30
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,624
That's how Tarrlok was able
to bloodbend us without a full moon.

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,293
But how did you escape?
And where's Tarrlok?

32
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,255
Amon captured him
and took his bending.

33
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,381
What?

34
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,093
Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere.
He almost got me, too.

35
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,554
This is very disturbing news.

36
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,514
Amon is becoming emboldened.

37
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,017
Taking out a councilman,
almost capturing the Avatar...

38
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,395
I fear Amon is entering his endgame.

39
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,027
Pema, are you all right?

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,114
The baby is just kicking
really hard, is all.

41
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,241
- I'm fine.
- Should I get Tenzin?

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,119
No reason to worry him. It's nothing.

43
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,538
Can I get some hot water?

44
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,039
Korra needs more tea.

45
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,125
You're a Firebender. Boil it yourself.

46
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,133
I'm going to step out,
in case you two want to talk.

47
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,638
Is there something
we need to talk about?

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,475
I've noticed how you treat Korra,

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,728
how you acted when she was missing.

50
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,206
You have feelings for her, don't you?

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,148
What? No.

52
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,985
She was taken by a crazy Bloodbender!
How did you expect me to act?

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,486
I like Korra.

54
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,364
But you've been keeping the truth
from me this whole time.

55
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,825
The truth? About what?

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,577
You're really going to make me say it?

57
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,079
Yes, because I don't know
what you're talking about.

58
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,999
The kiss, Mako. I know.

59
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,709
I... Well...

60
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,129
Bolin told you, didn't he?

61
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,423
Don't blame your brother
for what you did.

62
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,550
Do you have feelings for Korra, or not?

63
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,094
Look, things are crazy right now.

64
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,305
Can we deal
with our relationship problems later?

65
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,183
Well, there might not be
any relationship to worry about later.

66
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,601
Asami...

67
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,107
Lin, I need to ask you a favor.

68
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,068
It would mean the world to me,

69
00:03:56,152 --> 00:04:00,614
but I know it could be a potentially
awkward situation. Furthermore...

70
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,949
Spit it out already!

71
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,136
Will you stay here
and watch over Pema and the children

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,494
while I meet with the Council?

73
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,371
With everything that's happened lately,

74
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,082
I want to be sure
my family is in safe hands.

75
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,210
Of course I'll help, old friend.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,129
I didn't realize you two were out here.

77
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,215
Pema! Yes, yes...

78
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,092
Lin has agreed to help out around here

79
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,802
and keep an eye on things
while I'm away.

80
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,222
Thank you.
I could use the extra pair of hands.

81
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,016
Would you mind giving him a bath?
He's filthy.

82
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,187
This is not what I signed on for!

83
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,313
Thank you, Lin!

84
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,690
Oogi, yip yip!

85
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,572
I gotta poo! Really bad!

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,252
Do you know where my keys are?
I can't find them anywhere.

87
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,878
No, dear.

88
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,548
- Found them!
- Good, dear.

89
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,799
Don't wait up for me,

90
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,385
this Council session
will probably go late into the night.

91
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,263
The door, dear.

92
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,893
We're here to fix a spider-rat problem.

93
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,104
I didn't call an exterminator.

94
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,276
Dear?

95
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,530
I'm so relieved to see you!

96
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,824
The other Council members,
are they all right?

97
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,328
I'm afraid not.
I just received a call from Chief Saikhan.

98
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,330
They've all been captured!

99
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,165
This can't be happening.

100
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,335
The leadership of Republic City
is in your hands now.

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,142
It is a tragic day, indeed!

102
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,899
All right, kids, time to go inside.

103
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,112
We heard explosions. What's going on?

104
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,114
Republic City is under attack.

105
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,379
I've dreamed of this day for so long.

106
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,381
Yes. The time has come

107
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,593
for the Equalists to claim Republic City
as their own.

108
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,950
Where did you say you parked the car?

109
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,453
It's right around here somewhere.

110
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,079
There it is!

111
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,334
Nice parking job.

112
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,838
Hey, you guys got arrested
and left me alone with the car.

113
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,716
I made it very clear I don't know
how to drive.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,427
All things considered,
you did a great job.

115
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,388
But how are we going to pay
for all these parking tickets?

116
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,018
Relax, the city's under attack.

117
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,437
The police have more important things
to worry about.

118
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,316
This'll come in handy.

119
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,448
Why don't you sit in back? With Korra.

120
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,450
I think I will.

121
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,707
Everything all right?

122
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,168
Yeah. Everything's terrific.

123
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,212
Car! We're good.

124
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,387
Chief, Air Unit Seven was just
taken out by an Equalist airship!

125
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,847
They've crashed into the harbor!

126
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,474
Send a River Rescue Unit.

127
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,519
Chief, all River Rescue ships
have been sabotaged!

128
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,811
What?

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Chief Saikhan.

130
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,482
Tenzin! Am I glad to see you.

131
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,275
I was afraid you'd been captured, too.

132
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,153
I'm the only Council member left.
What's the status?

133
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,906
Amon has launched simultaneous
attacks across the boroughs.

134
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,784
The police are trying to regain control,
but we're spread too thin.

135
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,287
I need to send a wire.

136
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,497
To whom, Councilman?

137
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,332
The General of the United Forces.

138
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,970
Councilman, your wire has been sent.

139
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,264
Chief, the phone lines just went dead!

140
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,273
Catch.

141
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,945
Saikhan, the vents!

142
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,537
We need to evacuate immediately.
Everyone stay close to me!

143
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,389
Not these mecha-tanks again!

144
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,224
Saikhan. No.

145
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,044
Jump!

146
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,230
Thank you.

147
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,165
Tenzin has escaped once again.

148
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,252
I can't stand to see Asami
fighting alongside those benders.

149
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:38,673
We will capture them before long,
and you will have your daughter back.

150
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,427
Are you all right?

151
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,721
I'm fine. Thank you, kids.

152
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,307
Another moment later
and I would've been on my way to Amon.

153
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,018
Guys, look.

154
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,730
No.

155
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,975
Everyone, hide inside and remain calm.

156
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,563
Pull it together, Pema!
Didn't I just say remain calm?

157
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,774
Mommy, what's wrong?

158
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,651
The baby's coming!

159
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,279
- No.
- Not now, baby!

160
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,849
The children, where are they?

161
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,727
Don't worry, they're in the other room,
totally safe.

162
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,865
Stay away from my dad's ex-girlfriend!

163
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,830
Jinora, you shouldn't be out here!

164
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,500
Get off our island!

165
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,465
Girls, you need to go back
inside this instant!

166
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,885
Taste my fury!

167
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,972
Meelo, be careful!

168
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,232
Never mind.

169
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,694
Take these Equalists

170
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,821
and lock them in the temple's basement.

171
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,406
Nice work, kids.

172
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,950
Dad!

173
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,539
Thank goodness you're all right!

174
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,833
We caught the bad guys!

175
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,126
You let them fight?

176
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,087
Do you realize
what could have happened?

177
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,798
I would've been toast
if it weren't for your kids.

178
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,217
You should be proud.
You taught them well.

179
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,056
Go on, be with your wife.

180
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,270
Pema!

181
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,403
Tenzin.

182
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,322
I'm here, Pema.

183
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,907
Our new son.

184
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,040
Hello.

185
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,503
Come meet your new brother!

186
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,922
A brother? Well, it's about time!

187
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,219
Welcome! I'm Ikki and this is Jinora
and Meelo.

188
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:57,098
We have a super great family, and
we're so happy that you're a part of it.

189
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,892
What are you going to name him?

190
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,977
Can I pick?

191
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,979
We already chose a name.

192
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,023
Rohan.

193
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,991
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but...

194
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,118
More airships are coming.

195
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,288
Everything's not going to be fine,
is it, Daddy?

196
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,016
What do you want to do, Tenzin?

197
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,768
I need to protect my family

198
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,479
and get them as far away
from this conflict as possible.

199
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,565
If Amon got his hands on my children...

200
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,941
I hate to even think of it.

201
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,985
If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.

202
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,403
- But...
- No arguments.

203
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,947
You and your family
are the last Airbenders.

204
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,115
There's no way in the world

205
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,326
I'm letting Amon
take your bending away.

206
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,744
Thank you, Lin.

207
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,873
Korra, I want you to leave this island
and hide for the time being.

208
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,999
I'm not giving up.

209
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,043
I'm not asking you to.

210
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,046
I've sent word to the United Forces.
They will be here soon.

211
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,299
And once my family is safe, I will return.

212
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,260
With the reinforcements,
we can turn the tide in this war.

213
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,889
What you're saying is,
we need to be patient.

214
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,059
You're learning well.

215
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,152
- Stay safe, Korra.
- You, too.

216
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,072
Tenzin, if we're leaving,
we better do it now!

217
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,201
Oogi, yip yip.

218
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,817
Go! We'll hold them off.

219
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,487
Everyone, climb on!

220
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,115
Let's go, girl!

221
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,131
Mustache guy!

222
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,350
Nice one, Naga!

223
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,165
- They're gaining on us!
- Faster, Oogi!

224
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,852
Whatever happens to me,
don't turn back.

225
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,520
Lin, what are you doing?

226
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,212
That lady is my hero!

227
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,256
Yes, she is.

228
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,145
Korra, we should get moving.

229
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,962
Tell me where the Avatar is,
and I'll let you keep your bending.

230
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,215
I won't tell you anything, you monster!

231
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,467
Very well.

232
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,322
General, I just received a wire
from the Avatar.

233
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,492
She says Amon and his forces
have gained control of the city.

234
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,327
How do you want to respond?

235
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,331
Tell her we will be arriving
in three days' time.

236
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,126
And that I look forward to winning back
Republic City, together.

237
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,253
As you wish, General Iroh.

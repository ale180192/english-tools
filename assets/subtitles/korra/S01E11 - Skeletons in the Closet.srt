1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,335
Earth.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,920
Fire.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,755
Air.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,132
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,764
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,980
The Equalists are on the attack.

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,606
The Lieutenant and his Chi-blockers

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,152
invaded Air Temple Island
and forced Tenzin and his family to flee.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,361
In the daring escape,

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,656
Lin Beifong sacrificed herself
and saved the Airbenders.

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,868
But she was captured,
and Amon took her bending away.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,870
Now, Team Avatar is in hiding,

14
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,040
as they await help from
General Iroh and the United Forces.

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:50,466
It is a glorious day,
my Equalist brothers and sisters.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,720
Amon has torn down
the tyrannical bending government.

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,891
He has declared bending illegal.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,853
And he has the Avatar on the run.

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,066
Our great leader
has a vision for the future.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,235
One day soon,
bending will no longer exist,

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,073
and we will live in a world
where everyone is finally equal.

22
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:18,535
The United Forces are on their way
right now to try and stop that dream.

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,331
But we will prevail!

24
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,806
Can you believe Hiroshi?
"The Avatar's on the run."

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,058
I'm not running from anyone.

26
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,779
Let's go back up there
and knock some heads.

27
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,062
- They'll never know what hit 'em.
- Relax.

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,273
General Iroh's coming
with an entire fleet of battleships.

29
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,484
Then Amon
will be the one who's running.

30
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,070
I hate this "being patient" stuff.

31
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,911
You two were gone awhile.

32
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,122
We were doing reconnaissance.

33
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,581
Whatever.

34
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,083
Welcome back.

35
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,753
Hope you worked up an appetite,
'cause dinner is served.

36
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,591
Thanks so much for letting us hide out
with you the past few days.

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,051
Honored to oblige.

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,306
My associates and I heartily oppose
Amon's so-called Equalist policies.

39
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,643
We got benders and non-benders
livin' together down here.

40
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,354
But do you see us fightin'? No, siree.

41
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,399
We figured out
how to harmoniously coexist.

42
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,527
You are a wise and noble hobo.

43
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,032
This is the best tasting street gruel
I've ever had. Seriously.

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,120
I culled it from the finest dumpsters
the city has to offer.

45
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,096
Can't sleep either?

46
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,349
No. I have this awful pit in my stomach.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,726
Me, too.

48
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,937
It's so crazy. A few months ago,

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,441
I was in the South Pole,
practicing for my firebending test,

50
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,693
and now I'm in the middle of
an all-out war.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,113
I know.
We didn't even know each other then.

52
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,701
And now,
I can't imagine my life without you in it.

53
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,580
You're the most loyal, brave
and selfless person I've ever known.

54
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:32,002
I think you're pretty incredible, too,
but you already knew that.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,633
I should probably try to get some sleep.

56
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,552
Me, too. Good night.

57
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,847
Good night.

58
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,367
You will now be cleansed
of your impurity.

59
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,459
Next.

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,225
Coast is clear.

61
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,368
Once the United Forces arrive, we need
to be ready to help in any way we can.

62
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,036
They're here.

63
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,384
Amon had to know we were coming.

64
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,970
So why aren't we
meeting any resistance?

65
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,265
Wait a second.
Where are the Equalist airships?

66
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,064
I don't see any mecha-tanks, either.

67
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,370
Something's not right.

68
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,170
It's a trick.

69
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,892
Water and Earthbenders,
detonate those mines.

70
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,313
What is that sound?

71
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,159
What now?

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,630
Where does Hiroshi find the time
to keep inventing new, evil machines?

73
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,226
Incoming!

74
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,295
It's all right. I've got you.

75
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,799
Avatar Korra?

76
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,719
You saved my life. Thank you.

77
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,231
I was prepared to deal with
Sato's mecha-tanks,

78
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,067
- but not these new, high-speed aircraft.
- I know.

79
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,529
Every time we think we have
an advantage, Amon outsmarts us.

80
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,532
No matter what our plan is,
he always has a better one.

81
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,953
Amon is winning so far,
but we're not out of the fight yet.

82
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,330
I like this man's confidence.

83
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,792
So, how are we not out of the fight?

84
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,546
A second wave of reinforcements
is on the way, but I need to warn them.

85
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,548
Do you still have a way
to get a message out?

86
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,550
I know just the man for the job.

87
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,138
And who is the recipient
of this top secret message?

88
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,224
Commander Bumi,
second division of the United Forces.

89
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,393
- Tenzin's brother?
- Yes.

90
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,563
Bit of a wild man, but the bravest
commander you'll ever meet.

91
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,647
Ready, sir.

92
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,775
Fleet ambushed and destroyed
by Equalist aircraft.

93
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,278
Retreat to Red Sand Island
until my signal.

94
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,781
Do not approach city
until you receive the all-clear.

95
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,705
Now comes the hard part.
We need to ground those aircraft.

96
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,167
Otherwise, Bumi's fleet
will never be able to retake the city.

97
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,877
They flew in from this direction.

98
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,213
The airfield must be
somewhere over this mountain range.

99
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,133
Everyone get ready. We leave at dawn.

100
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,722
It's time to take down my father.

101
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,937
Wait.

102
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,983
I'm sorry,
but I'm not going with you tomorrow.

103
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,610
- What?
- Why not?

104
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,530
I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon.
It's time I face him.

105
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,492
That's not a good plan.
We need to stick together.

106
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,661
I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down.

107
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,873
My gut's telling me
it's time to end this on my terms.

108
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,543
Korra, this is not a mission
you should be handling alone.

109
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,921
She won't be. I'm going with you.

110
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,635
- You don't have to do that.
- Yes. I do.

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,351
My grandfather would respect
the Avatar's instinct.

112
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,644
So will I.

113
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,443
Love you, little bro.

114
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,404
Love you back, big bro.

115
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,204
Korra, Amon is a nasty dude. Be careful.

116
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,665
I will. Good luck.

117
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,336
If you're going into the mountains,
you should bring Naga.

118
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,297
Take good care of Bolin for me.

119
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,676
Asami.

120
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,304
I'm sorry
things got so messed up between us.

121
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,517
But whatever happens today, I want you
to know how much I care about you.

122
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,853
I care about you, too.

123
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:30,623
Good fortune and success to you,
valiant heroes.

124
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,565
There's Amon.

125
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,321
We need to get into the temple.
Then, when he returns...

126
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,739
We ambush him.

127
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,746
What are you two doing here?

128
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,916
We were just transferred.

129
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,376
Well, you're getting transferred again.

130
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,505
Amon wants extra security
at the arena today.

131
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,299
- The arena? For what?
- The rally.

132
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,760
You should have been
briefed about this.

133
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,762
We'll be there, sir.

134
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,765
I know another way in.

135
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,111
Let's hide in the attic.

136
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,410
We're not alone up here.

137
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,621
Tarrlok?

138
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,376
I don't suppose
you're here to rescue me.

139
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,170
We had no idea you were here.

140
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,938
Are there other prisoners on the island?

141
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,424
No. I'm the only one.

142
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,802
And what makes you so special?

143
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,805
I'm Amon's brother.

144
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,070
Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.

145
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,824
He is a Waterbender
and a Bloodbender, just like I was.

146
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,284
What?

147
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,160
Did you know this all along?

148
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,455
No. Not until after he captured me.

149
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,709
How did your brother
end up becoming Amon?

150
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,837
It all began with my father, Yakone.

151
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,840
With the help of his former gang,

152
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,970
he escaped prison and underwent
surgery to change his appearance.

153
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:54,058
He assumed a new identity and settled
down in the Northern Water Tribe.

154
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,855
That's where he met my mother,
a warm, caring woman.

155
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,863
Before long,
they started a family together.

156
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,116
Amon was the firstborn,
under the name Noatak.

157
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,994
I was born three years later.

158
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,290
Noatak was a good-natured kid,
always looking out for me.

159
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,876
Those were the good years,

160
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,880
before my brother and I discovered
we were Waterbenders.

161
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,883
At first,
we were excited by our new abilities,

162
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,886
but our training
brought out a different side of my father.

163
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,430
Tarrlok, you better shape up,

164
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,892
or you'll be out here in the cold all night,
until you get it right.

165
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,186
- I'm trying, but...
- Try harder.

166
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,605
Your brother was never this sloppy.

167
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,150
Dad, he'll get it. He just needs time.

168
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,986
Don't talk back to me, son. Ever.

169
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,780
Even back then,

170
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,908
my brother wanted everyone
to be treated fairly and equally.

171
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,330
When I was seven, my father
took me and Noatak on a hunting trip,

172
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,624
far away from our home.

173
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,211
He told us his true identity was Yakone,

174
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,589
Republic City's
most notorious crime boss,

175
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,343
and that he was once
a Bloodbender of rare skill.

176
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,929
What's bloodbending?

177
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,600
The most powerful and feared form
of bending in the world.

178
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,854
It was declared illegal,
thanks to that coward, Katara.

179
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,025
Our family has the strongest line
of Bloodbenders in history.

180
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:31,030
You boys have this power inside of you.
And I will teach you to master it.

181
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,616
What happened to your bending, Dad?

182
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,412
The Avatar stole it from me.

183
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,541
That's why I brought you out here,
to learn your destiny.

184
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,961
You two will become
Bloodbenders of the highest order.

185
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,715
When the time is right,
you will claim Republic City,

186
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,967
and you will destroy the Avatar.

187
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,428
You must avenge me.

188
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,389
That is your purpose in life.

189
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,267
The good days were behind us.

190
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,357
Every full moon, our father took us on
another supposed hunting trip,

191
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,819
where he secretly
trained us in bloodbending.

192
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,196
We kept the truth from our mother.

193
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,623
Stop. You're hurting it.

194
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,669
Toughen up, Tarrlok.
You'll need a thicker skin for this.

195
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,970
Very good, son. Very good.

196
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,935
A few years later, my father
taught us to bloodbend anytime,

197
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,229
without the need of the full moon.

198
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:50,026
We practiced constantly,
and I hated every minute of it.

199
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,585
I had no stomach
for manipulating helpless animals.

200
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,048
My brother, however,
seemed to revel in his newfound power.

201
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,598
He was a prodigy, mastering my father's
psychic bloodbending technique

202
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,517
by the time he was 14.

203
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:45,248
That's the way it's done.
That's what you need to strive for.

204
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:52,088
Even though Noatak was my father's
favorite, it wasn't any easier for him.

205
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,884
He carried the burden of
all Yakone's expectations and demands.

206
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,557
Something changed in Noatak
over the years.

207
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,727
The loving brother I once knew
became cold and detached.

208
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,942
Our father pushed us to extremes,

209
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,196
and one day,
he made us bloodbend each other.

210
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,199
Noatak. Go.

211
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,258
Excellent.

212
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,100
Tarrlok. Your turn.

213
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,768
No.

214
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,145
I won't do it.

215
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,314
Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok.

216
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,024
That felt awful.

217
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,819
I don't want to do that to anyone.
I never want to bloodbend again.

218
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,615
You're a disgrace, a weakling.

219
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,118
I'll teach you a lesson,
you insubordinate...

220
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,164
Stay away from him.

221
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,667
How dare you bloodbend me!

222
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,004
What are you going to do about it?
You're the weak one.

223
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,552
You always say bloodbending
is the most powerful thing in the world,

224
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,139
but it isn't. The Avatar is.

225
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,433
He took your bending away.

226
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,560
What could be more powerful than that?

227
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,189
I made you what you are.

228
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,149
You're mine.

229
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,195
We're your sons,
not your tools of revenge.

230
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,366
Let's go.
We can run away from him. Forever.

231
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,328
Run away? But what about Mom?
We can't just leave her.

232
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,374
He was right about you.
You are a weakling.

233
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,509
Noatak! Don't leave, please!

234
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,803
Noatak!

235
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,688
My father and I searched for days,
but we never found a sign of Noatak.

236
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,024
We thought he perished in that storm.

237
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,361
My mother was never the same
after the loss of my brother.

238
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,366
My father stopped training me.

239
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,412
With Noatak gone,
his hopes for revenge withered,

240
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,707
and he passed away a few years later.

241
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,800
That's one of the saddest stories
I've ever heard.

242
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,305
Avatar Korra,
I am truly sorry for all that I did to you.

243
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:52,268
I thought I was better than my father,
but his ghost still shaped me.

244
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,105
I became a soldier of revenge,
just like he wanted me to be.

245
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,816
And so did my brother.

246
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,653
The revolution may be built on a lie,

247
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:08,492
but I think Amon truly believes bending
is the source of all evil in the world.

248
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,953
How did you figure out
Amon is your brother?

249
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,791
When he took my bending,
the sensation was somehow familiar.

250
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,170
I later recognized it as
my brother's bloodbending grip.

251
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,300
So he somehow uses bloodbending
to take people's bending?

252
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,552
I don't know how he does it,

253
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,222
but then again, I've never encountered
a bender as strong as Noatak.

254
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,309
- How in the world do we beat him?
- We can't.

255
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,021
Any attack we throw at him,
he'll redirect with his mind.

256
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,190
That's how he's been able
to challenge any bender.

257
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,526
So much for our ambush.
If we stay here, we're toast.

258
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,738
- But there's another way to beat him.
- How?

259
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,408
This whole time,
Amon has been one step ahead of us.

260
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,412
But finally we have the advantage.
We know the truth about him.

261
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,333
If we expose him as a bender
in front of all his supporters...

262
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,334
At the rally.

263
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,336
We could take away his true power.

264
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,338
And undermine this whole revolution.

265
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,383
Thank you for your help.

266
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,847
- We can't just leave him here.
- Go.

267
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,725
Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.

268
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,521
Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story.

1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,626
Earth.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,503
Fire.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,255
Air.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,840
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,886
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,097
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,563
After a close encounter with Amon,

8
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,566
Korra took a leave of absence
from Tarrlok's task force.

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,776
But the Avatar
has still been hard at work,

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,321
leading the underdog Fire Ferrets
to the Pro-bending championship finals.

11
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,575
Only one team stands in their way,
the Wolf-bats.

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,909
Led by team captain Tahno,

13
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,162
the brutal Wolf-bats
look to repeat as champs.

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,080
Have the Fire Ferrets
finally met their match?

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,016
You are listening to the Music Hour,

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,602
brought to you by Cabbage Corp.

17
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:06,065
Republic City's trusted name
in technology for over 50 years.

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,192
Man, I got a good feeling about tonight!

19
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,820
I don't care if we are the underdogs,
we can take those pompous Wolf-bats.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,032
It's going to be our toughest match ever,
but I think you're right.

21
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:20,829
Introducing your new champs,
the fantastic Fire Ferrets!

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,833
Good morning, citizens of Republic City.

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,293
This is Amon.

24
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,963
I hope you all enjoyed last night's
Pro-bending match,

25
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,966
because it will be the last.

26
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,887
It's time for this city
to stop worshipping bending athletes

27
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,388
as if they were heroes.

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,768
I am calling on the Council
to shut down the bending Arena

29
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,020
and cancel the finals,

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,066
or else there will be
severe consequences.

31
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,860
That guy's got some nerve!

32
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,130
You think the Council will give in?

33
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,115
I'm not waiting to find out.
We need to get to City Hall.

34
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,083
Korra, you shouldn't be here.
This is a closed meeting.

35
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,003
As the Avatar, and a Pro-bending
player, I have a right to be heard.

36
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,296
You can't cancel the finals.

37
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,007
I know winning the Championship
means a lot to you,

38
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,052
but as far as I'm concerned,
we need to shut the Arena down.

39
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,595
What about the rest of you?

40
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,598
Tarrlok, there's no way
you're backing down from Amon, right?

41
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,977
Actually, Tenzin and I agree, for once.

42
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,063
The Council is unanimous.
We're closing the Arena.

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,731
- No!
- You can't!

44
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,816
I don't understand.

45
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,194
I thought you of all people
would take a stand against Amon.

46
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,115
While I am still committed
to bringing that lunatic to justice,

47
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,534
I will not put innocent lives at stake,

48
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,996
just so you and your friends
can play a game.

49
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,540
Pro-bending might only
be a game to you,

50
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,417
but think of what it means to the city.

51
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,129
Right now the Arena is the one place
where benders and non-benders

52
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,631
gather together in peace

53
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,134
- to watch benders...
- Beat each other up

54
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,677
in peace!

55
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,971
It's an inspiration to everyone!

56
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,432
I appreciate your naive idealism,

57
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,143
but you're ignoring
the reality of the situation.

58
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,813
The reality is, if you close the Arena,
you let Amon win!

59
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,191
Yes, exactly what she said! Yes.

60
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,527
I'm sorry, but our decision
has been made.

61
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,945
This meeting is adjourned.

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,163
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I agree with the Avatar.

63
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,790
- You do?
- Yeah, you do?

64
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,169
I expected this kind of cut and run
response from Tenzin,

65
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,712
but the rest of you?

66
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,590
Come on, show a little more backbone.

67
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,176
It's time that the benders of this city

68
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,512
displayed some strength and unity
against these Equalists.

69
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,225
We must prevent the conflict
between benders and non-benders

70
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,185
from escalating into all-out war!

71
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,771
The Council is not changing
its position, Lin.

72
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,106
Now, just a moment, Tenzin.

73
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,027
Let us hear what our esteemed
Chief of Police has in mind.

74
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,988
If you keep the Arena open,

75
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,198
my metalbenders and I

76
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,284
will provide extra security
during the Championship match.

77
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,995
There's no better force
to deal with the Chi-blockers.

78
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,331
Our armor is impervious to their attacks.

79
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,126
Are you saying that you will
personally take responsibility

80
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,837
for the safety of the spectators
in the Arena?

81
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,172
I guarantee it.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,510
It is hard to argue
with Chief Beifong's track record.

83
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,305
If she is confident her elite officers
can protect the Arena,

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,432
then she has my support.

85
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,268
I am changing my vote.

86
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,228
Who else is with me?

87
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,232
The Arena stays open.

88
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,775
Good luck in the finals.

89
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,819
- All right!
- Thank you!

90
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,197
And good luck to you, Chief Beifong.

91
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,242
A word, please, Lin.

92
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,663
Tarrlok's playing you,
and I don't want to see you get hurt.

93
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,332
I know what I'm doing
and the risks that come with it.

94
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,127
In that case, I'm going to be
by your side during the match.

95
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,296
You don't need to babysit me.

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,257
It's for Korra.
I want to make sure she's safe.

97
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,011
Do what you want. It's not like
I've ever been able to stop you before.

98
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,264
Excuse me, Chief Beifong?
I wanted to thank you for your help.

99
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,850
It really means a lot.

100
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,269
What is her deal?

101
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,771
Even when she's on my side,
she's against me.

102
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,648
I've known Lin since we were children.

103
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,233
She's always been

104
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,277
challenging.

105
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,780
What did your father do
to make her hate the Avatar so much?

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,116
My father and Lin got along famously.

107
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,161
I'm afraid her issues are with me.

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,830
Wait a second.

109
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,373
It all makes sense now!

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,294
You and Beifong, Beifong and you.
You two were a couple!

111
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,047
What? How...
Where'd you get that idea?

112
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,049
Your wife.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,551
Criminy!
I'll have to have a word with her.

114
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,930
So Pema stole you from Beifong?

115
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,601
I'm surprised our esteemed Chief
of Police didn't throw her in jail.

116
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,852
Oh, she tried.

117
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,270
Anyway, Pema didn't "steal" me.

118
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,607
Lin and I had been growing apart
for some time.

119
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,152
We both had different goals in life...

120
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,029
Why am I even telling you this?

121
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,991
It all happened a long time ago
and we've moved past it.

122
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,534
Apparently Beifong hasn't.

123
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,621
What do you... Of course she has...

124
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,915
Anyway, this is none of your business!

125
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,626
See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!

126
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,803
I just got word.

127
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,389
The Council defied your threat.

128
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,100
They're keeping the Arena open.

129
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,267
Perfect.

130
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,020
Everything is going according to plan.

131
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,422
All clear, Chief.

132
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,677
- How is the security sweep going?
- Fine.

133
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,364
They've checked
underneath the stands?

134
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,388
Yes.

135
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,765
And you have enough officers
to cover all points of entry?

136
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,019
I have the skies, the bay, and every
nook and cranny of this place covered.

137
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,355
Now leave me alone
and let me do my job.

138
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,566
Lin, with so much on the line,

139
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,403
it would be nice if we could help
each other out, at least for one night.

140
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,074
- Like old times?
- Like old times.

141
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,413
Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive
than usual.

142
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,414
I would appreciate that.

143
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,420
The anticipation is palpable

144
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,214
as we are just moments away
from the Championship match.

145
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,342
Will the Wolf-bats' ferocity
help them repeat as Champs,

146
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,012
or will the underdog
Fire Ferrets serve up

147
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,347
a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?

148
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,516
Now I know there's a big crowd,

149
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,894
but don't be nervous,
you're gonna do great.

150
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,228
I believe in you.

151
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,740
Introducing the challengers,

152
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:16,077
the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!

153
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,477
You're on, Pabu!

154
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,488
Yes! Nailed it! He's so talented.

155
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,990
And their opponents,

156
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,494
the three-time defending champions,

157
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,413
the White Falls Wolf-bats!

158
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,515
They got nothing on us, buddy.
Anybody can howl.

159
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,892
Whatever.

160
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,527
I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair
off his stupid head.

161
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,530
The champs and challengers face off
at the center line.

162
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,365
And here we go!

163
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,789
Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's
clock with some dirty water-boxing!

164
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,542
Ming shakes off Mako's attack
and returns the favor.

165
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,551
Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets

166
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,304
a disk off the ropes and says,
"No thank you, sir!"

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,097
Nice shot!

168
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,477
The waterbenders slug it out,
looking evenly matched.

169
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,832
Tahno gets a little too worked up

170
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,108
and unleashes a deluge on Bolin
that will certainly elicit a foul...

171
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,943
Or apparently not!

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,155
What's the big idea, ref?
That was a hosing foul!

173
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,615
And the Wolf-bats advance

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,242
despite Tahno exceeding
the waterbending time limit.

175
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,244
A questionable call by the officials.

176
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,415
Ming trips up Mako
with another dirty trick!

177
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,125
Come on, refs!

178
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,294
There was some funny business
in that last play!

179
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,690
Wouldn't have guessed you knew
the rules of Pro-bending.

180
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,340
I've been brushing up.

181
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,384
That Wolf-bat blatantly bent a disk
outside of his zone.

182
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,386
The Ferret brothers are backed up
to Zone 3

183
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,221
and the Wolf-bats smell blood.

184
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,521
Looks like Tahno snuck in
an illegal icing move,

185
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,231
but once again there's no call.

186
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,044
I don't know what match
the refs are watching,

187
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,610
but it's obviously not this one.

188
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,283
A splash and crash send
the Avatar to Zone 3 as well!

189
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,620
It's a knockout!

190
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,623
The Wolf-bats win the championship
for the fourth year in a...

191
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,250
Hold on a second, folks!

192
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,837
Scratch that. The Ferrets are still alive!
But just barely!

193
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,808
What an unbelievable move!

194
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,645
These Ferrets aren't just bending
the elements, they're bending my mind!

195
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,606
The underdogs survive
to see round two!

196
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,653
- What's wrong with these refs?
- They've been paid off.

197
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,656
It's the only explanation.
Someone wants us to lose.

198
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,659
If the Wolf-bats are going to fight dirty,
then so should we.

199
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,495
No, we can't. The refs have it out for us.

200
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,206
If we're going to win this thing,
it has to be fair and square.

201
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,668
That's no fun, but all right.

202
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,503
Round two!

203
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,884
The opening salvo is a brutal brawl
as both sides give it their all!

204
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,930
But once again, Tahno sneaks in
a little ice to get the upper hand.

205
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,019
Those look like illegal headshots to me!

206
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,692
Round two will be decided
with a tiebreaker!

207
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,700
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!

208
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,660
Which element do you choose?

209
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm taking this one.

210
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,706
Let's go! You and me, pretty boy.

211
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,666
I thought you'd never ask.

212
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,847
Come on, little girl.
Give me your best shot.

213
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,653
Chump.

214
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,660
Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets!

215
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,749
- Nice one!
- That's the stuff!

216
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,418
You are my hero!

217
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,212
We might actually win this thing!

218
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,342
Let's send them to a watery grave.

219
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,138
I can't believe your sweet-tempered
father was reincarnated into that girl.

220
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,681
She's tough as nails.

221
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,767
Reminds me of someone else
I knew at that age.

222
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,770
You two might get along,
if you would only give her a chance.

223
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,858
One round a piece! Who wants it more?

224
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,571
The Wolf-bats fly out of the gate,
swinging with bad intentions.

225
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,406
The challengers are showing
a lot of heart,

226
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,034
but the champs are really
starting to find their rhythm now.

227
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,119
Can the Ferrets hang in there
with the best,

228
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,790
especially when the best are, frankly,
getting a little help from the refs?

229
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,376
It's all down to this final round!

230
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,712
Mako is leaving it all in the ring,

231
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,799
but it looks like Tahno and Ming
are up to more shenanigans!

232
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,848
This has gone too far!

233
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,641
That water had rocks in it!

234
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,268
Knockout!

235
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,728
Come on!
Those were illegal headshots!

236
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,230
Open your eyes, ref!

237
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,982
Well folks, it's a controversial call,

238
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,277
but the Wolf-bats notch
a nasty knockout to win the match!

239
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,239
For the fourth year in a row they'll be
crowned tournament champions!

240
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,825
I barely broke a sweat.

241
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,620
Anybody else wanna scrap
with the champs?

242
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,858
Look out!

243
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,588
What?

244
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,268
Folks, there is some sort of
electrical disturbance in the stands.

245
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,896
Metalbender cops
are dropping like bumble-flies!

246
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,899
There appear to be masked members
of the audience

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,693
wielding strange devices on their hands.

248
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,988
One of them is in the booth
with me right now, folks.

249
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,908
He is leveling one of those
glove devices at me now,

250
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,786
and I believe
he is about to electrocute me.

251
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,955
I am currently wetting my pants.

252
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,068
- What's going on here, ref?
- I don't know!

253
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,157
All right, you want a piece
of the Wolf-bats?

254
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,742
Here it comes!

255
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,762
Wait! Please, don't do this!
I'll give you the championship pot!

256
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,974
I'll give you everything,
just please don't take my bending!

257
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,888
I believe I have your attention,
benders of Republic City.

258
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,225
So, once again, the Wolf-bats
are your Pro-bending champions.

259
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,439
It seems fitting that you celebrate three
bullies who cheated their way to victory.

260
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,692
Because every day,
you threaten and abuse

261
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,028
your fellow non-bending citizens,

262
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,740
just like the Wolf-bats did
to their opponents tonight.

263
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:01,037
Those men were supposedly
the best in the bending world.

264
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,042
And yet it only took a few moments
for me to cleanse them of their impurity.

265
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,630
Let this be a warning
to all of you benders out there.

266
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,174
If any of you stand in my way,

267
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,636
you will meet the same fate.

268
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,056
Now, to my followers...

269
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,977
For years, the Equalists have been
forced to hide in the shadows.

270
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:29,023
But now, we have the numbers
and the strength

271
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,943
to create a new Republic City.

272
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,298
I'm happy to tell you that the time
for change has finally come.

273
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,906
How are we gonna get out of here?

274
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,119
Very soon, the current
tyrannical bending regime...

275
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,954
Pabu! Listen up, buddy.

276
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,498
Will be replaced by a fair-minded,
Equalist government.

277
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,084
- You and your children...
- Stop fooling around!

278
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,128
I'm not, I'm trying to save us!

279
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,965
It's time to take back our city.

280
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,809
See?
Pabu's not just a one-trick poodle-pony.

281
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,637
For centuries, benders have possessed
an unnatural advantage

282
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,472
over ordinary people.

283
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,101
But thankfully, modern technology
has provided us

284
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,062
with a way to even out the playing field.

285
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,067
Now anyone can hold the power
of a Chi-blocker in their hand.

286
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:18,739
My followers and I will not rest
until the entire city achieves equality.

287
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:25,329
And once that goal is achieved,
we will equalize the rest of the world.

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,833
The Revolution has begun!

289
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,150
Tenzin!

290
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,661
It's okay, Pabu, just a little explosion!

291
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,623
Keep chewing, you're almost through it!

292
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,376
Yes! Great job, buddy!

293
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,506
- I'm going after Amon!
- Be careful!

294
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
You all right?

295
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,332
I'm fine, thanks to you.

296
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,250
Don't mention it, kid.

297
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,586
Looks like we lost this one.

298
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,341
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me, too.

299
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,348
I can't believe Amon did this.
I played right into his hand.

300
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,766
He played us all.

301
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,268
Republic City is at war.

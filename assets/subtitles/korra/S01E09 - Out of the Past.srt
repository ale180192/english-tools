1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,293
Earth.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,004
Fire.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,880
Air.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,007
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,180
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,105
The Avatar has been abducted!

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,982
After Tarrlok arrested her friends,

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,359
Korra confronted the councilman
in his chambers.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,030
But the heated argument quickly turned
into an all-out bending battle.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,364
Desperate to save himself,

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,450
Tarrlok revealed his ability to bloodbend

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,994
and took Korra far from Republic City.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,372
Will the Avatar's friends find her
before it's too late?

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,031
What are you doing?

16
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,699
Tarrlok!

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,411
You can't keep me in here forever!

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,858
Who is this? It's 6:00 in the morning,

19
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,985
this better be important.

20
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,905
Councilman Tenzin here.

21
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,865
What?

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,922
What happened?
What was Korra doing at City Hall?

23
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,426
As I told Chief Saikhan,
Korra came to my office late last night.

24
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,096
She was upset
that I arrested her friends.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,765
She asked me to release them,

26
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,410
and that's when the Equalists attacked.

27
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,106
I tried to protect Korra,
but we were outnumbered.

28
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,900
Then, I was electrocuted.

29
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,366
When I came to, the police had arrived,
but Korra was gone.

30
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,118
I'm so sorry.

31
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,121
Chief Saikhan,
mobilize the entire police force.

32
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,248
We have to find the Avatar.

33
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,544
We interrupt
your regularly scheduled broadcast

34
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,379
to bring you this special report.

35
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,715
Late last night,
Equalists attacked City Hall,

36
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,926
subduing Councilman Tarrlok
and capturing Avatar Korra.

37
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,137
Details are still coming in, but...

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,543
Hope you got enough beauty rest.

39
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,587
Come on, I'm busting you out.

40
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,172
Thanks, I owe you.

41
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,177
Are you done yet?

42
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,930
Cover your ears.
I can't go with you listening!

43
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,391
Asami!

44
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,936
A little privacy, please!

45
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,979
Are you all right?

46
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,190
I'm fine. It's so good to see you.

47
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,192
Hate to break up your lovers' reunion,

48
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,111
but Korra's in trouble.
Amon captured her.

49
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,199
No. No, she can't be gone.

50
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,952
Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,624
Your fly was down.

52
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,209
Thanks for catching that.

53
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:24,179
Somebody! Help! Please!

54
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,517
Please...

55
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,230
I urge you to meditate on these visions.

56
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,233
I believe Aang's spirit
is trying to tell you something.

57
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,164
What are you doing here, Aang?

58
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,792
I told you, I have this under control.

59
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,420
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't get involved.

60
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,064
But if what those victims said is true,

61
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,132
we're not dealing
with a normal criminal.

62
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,801
Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes.

63
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,928
Toph, I'm 40 years old,

64
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,180
you think you could stop
with the nicknames?

65
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,473
Afraid not.

66
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,605
It's over. You're under arrest, Yakone.

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,483
What is Republic City coming to?

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,862
Used to be,
a man could enjoy his lunch in peace.

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,242
What's the big idea?

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,037
We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone.

71
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,288
We know what you are.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,414
Take him away.

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,626
I've beaten every trumped-up charge
you yahoos have brought against me,

74
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,920
and I'll beat this one, too!

75
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,302
I finally connected with you, Aang.

76
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,055
But what are you trying to tell me?

77
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,307
A way out of this box would be nice.

78
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,731
I have to go.

79
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,400
Call me back
the minute you hear anything.

80
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,111
Lin, what are you...

81
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,613
You should be in the hospital!

82
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,281
And you three, you should be in prison!

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,575
I figured you could use our help
finding Korra.

84
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,077
Do you have any leads?

85
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,330
I've been on the phone all morning,
but, nothing yet.

86
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,624
We need Naga. She can track Korra.

87
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,377
I'm afraid her polar bear-dog
is missing as well.

88
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,711
Then where do we start?

89
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,464
My guess is
the Equalists are hiding underground

90
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,758
in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.

91
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,845
Underground,
just like my father's secret factory.

92
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,055
Figures.

93
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,765
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

94
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,619
When those Chi-blockers had me
in their truck,

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,394
it sounded like we drove into a tunnel.

96
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,688
I know where to start looking. Come on!

97
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,941
Wherever Amon is keeping Korra,

98
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,360
I bet that's where my officers are, too.

99
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,362
Let's bring them all home, Lin.

100
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,875
The truck with Bolin took off
down this alley.

101
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,381
Which way?

102
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,926
This way kind of smells familiar.

103
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,682
There's a tunnel nearby.

104
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,061
There!

105
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,316
Motorcycle tracks.

106
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,485
Korra has to be in there...

107
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,070
Somewhere.

108
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,209
Let's try this way.

109
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,711
And what if Korra's not down there?

110
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,921
Then we pick another tunnel
until we find her.

111
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,430
Hey, is Mako all right?

112
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,724
He seems really worried about Korra.

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,434
Yeah, we all are.

114
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,437
I know, but he's your brother.

115
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you think he likes Korra
as more than just a friend?

116
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,445
What? No. That's just gossip,
where'd you hear that?

117
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,448
Crazy talk is coming out
of your mouth right now.

118
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,243
What do you know, Bolin?
Come on, spill it.

119
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,912
Nothing! I mean...

120
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,539
There was this one time
during the tournament

121
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,041
when Mako and Korra kissed, but...

122
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,375
They kissed?

123
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,962
Believe me, I was upset, too,
but I'm over it.

124
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,422
I don't think it meant anything.

125
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,090
I doubt that.

126
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,347
Hide!

127
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,464
That tram goes to the training camp.

128
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,510
Everything was delivered
to the prison, sir.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,138
That's where
they must be keeping Korra.

130
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,932
We need to get down that tunnel.

131
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,415
- It's empty.
- Yeah, I can see that.

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,423
You two keep an eye on them.

133
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,805
My officers are inside.

134
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,557
What about Korra?

135
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,058
I don't see her yet.

136
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,744
Avatar Korra,
where are you keeping her?

137
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,585
Chief Beifong?

138
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,087
I'm too late.

139
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,632
That monster already took
your bending, didn't he?

140
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,594
I'm so sorry.

141
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,721
Come on, let's get you out of here.

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll ask you one more time.

143
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,268
Where is she?

144
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,770
We don't have the Avatar.

145
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,064
And the Equalists didn't attack City Hall.

146
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,066
- Tarrlok's lying.
- What?

147
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,361
I scanned the entire prison.
Korra's not here.

148
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,155
Why would Tarrlok make up a story
about getting attacked?

149
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,700
Because he has Korra. He fooled us all.

150
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,039
Let's go, people!

151
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,769
Try to Chi-block that, fools!

152
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,860
We got more company!

153
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,657
Hang on!

154
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,514
Yakone has ruled Republic City's
criminal empire for years.

155
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,892
Yet he has always managed
to stay out of the law's reach,

156
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,686
until now.

157
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,939
You will hear testimony
from dozens of his victims.

158
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,024
And they will tell you

159
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,319
Yakone has maintained his grip
on the underworld

160
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,699
by using an ability
that has been illegal for decades,

161
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,367
bloodbending.

162
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:32,709
The prosecution's entire case
is built upon the make-believe notion

163
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,713
that my client is able to bloodbend
at will,

164
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,007
at any time, on any day.

165
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,175
I remind the Council

166
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,636
that bloodbending
is an incredibly rare skill,

167
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,890
and it can only be performed
during a full moon.

168
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:51,519
Yet the witnesses will claim
that my client used bloodbending

169
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,354
at every other time,

170
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,690
except during a full moon.

171
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,776
It would be a mockery of justice

172
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,114
to convict a man of a crime
that is impossible to commit.

173
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,750
Councilman Sokka will now deliver
the verdict.

174
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,669
In my years, I have encountered people

175
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,589
born with rare
and unique bending abilities.

176
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,050
I once bested a man
with my trusty boomerang

177
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,136
who was able to firebend with his mind.

178
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,931
Why, even metalbending
was considered impossible

179
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,432
for all of history,

180
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,811
until our esteemed Chief of Police,
Toph Beifong,

181
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,772
single-handedly developed the skill.

182
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,566
The overwhelming amount
of testimony and evidence

183
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,193
has convinced this Council

184
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,238
that Yakone is one
of these unique benders.

185
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,075
And he exploited his ability
to commit these heinous crimes.

186
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,412
We find Yakone guilty of all charges

187
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,123
and sentence him to life in prison.

188
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,080
Thank you all for meeting us
on such short notice.

189
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,790
- Chief.
- Lin.

190
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,835
Have you news of Avatar Korra?

191
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,838
We do. You kidnapped her, Tarrlok.

192
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,592
I am shocked you would accuse me
of such an evil act.

193
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,845
I already explained,
Equalists attacked us and took her!

194
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,556
But there were no Chi-blockers here
last night.

195
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,391
You planted the evidence, didn't you?

196
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,852
That is a ridiculous accusation!

197
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,771
It's true! He took her!

198
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,691
I was here when Avatar Korra
arrived last night,

199
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,735
but Councilman Tarrlok
ordered me to leave.

200
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,861
I was on my way out

201
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,822
when I saw Tarrlok bring her down
to the garage...

202
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,575
Say goodbye to Republic City,
Avatar Korra.

203
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,035
You'll never see it again.

204
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,668
That is nonsense!

205
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,254
Everyone knows you're nothing
but a squeaky-voiced liar!

206
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,381
Why did you wait until now to fess up?

207
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,759
I was terrified to tell because...

208
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,761
Because Tarrlok is a Bloodbender!

209
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,846
He bloodbent Avatar Korra!

210
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,059
Don't make this worse for yourself.
Tell us where you have Korra.

211
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,216
Wake up.

212
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,930
Man, I had this awful dream

213
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,140
that Korra was taken
by this evil Bloodbender.

214
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,350
So weird.

215
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,019
Bolin, that really happened.
He knocked us out.

216
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,939
Are you serious? Where is he?
Is he here right now?

217
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,359
Tarrlok is long gone.
I'll alert the whole force.

218
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,861
We've only been out for a little while.

219
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,947
Maybe we can still pick up
Tarrlok's trail.

220
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,533
It could lead us to Korra. Let's go.

221
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,109
Yakone, you won't get away with this!

222
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,989
Republic City is mine, Avatar.

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,991
I'll be back one day to claim it.

224
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,537
This time, I'm gonna put you to sleep
for good!

225
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,353
I'm taking away your bending, for good.

226
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,656
It's over.

227
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,078
Aang, this whole time,

228
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,580
you were trying to warn me
about Tarrlok.

229
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,087
My life is a disaster now, thanks to you!

230
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,756
So your little bloodbending secret's out?

231
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,469
And I know how you bloodbent me
without a full moon.

232
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,971
You're Yakone's son!

233
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,099
I was his son.

234
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,311
But in order to win Republic City,
I had to become someone else.

235
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,105
My father failed

236
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,109
because he tried to rule the city
from its rotten underbelly.

237
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,736
My plan was perfect.

238
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,239
I was to be the city's savior.

239
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,368
But you... You ruined everything!

240
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,663
Tarrlok, the jig is up
and you have nowhere to go.

241
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:30,126
No. No, I'll escape and start a new life.

242
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,838
And you're coming as my hostage.

243
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,132
You'll never get away with this!

244
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,014
Amon!

245
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,143
It is time for you to be equalized.

246
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,355
You fool. You've never faced
bending like mine!

247
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,165
What... What are you?

248
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,709
I am the solution.

249
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,937
I'll take care of him.
You four retrieve the Avatar.

250
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,813
Do not underestimate her.

251
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,067
Electrocute the box to knock her out
before you open it.

252
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,193
My pleasure.

253
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,494
It's payback time.

254
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,595
Open the box.

255
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,225
Tie her up.

256
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,263
I thought I told you
not to underestimate her.

257
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,254
Naga, you came looking for me.
Good girl.

258
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,315
That sounds like Naga!

259
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,943
Down there!

260
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,447
Korra!

261
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,574
Thank goodness!

262
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,243
Where's Tarrlok?
How did you get away?

263
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,037
Give her some space.

264
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,338
I was so worried. Are you all right?

265
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm fine.

266
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,258
I'm glad you're here.

267
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,140
You're safe now.
